#Let's make a card game

## The Plan

So for the longest time I've wanted to make a game, but have had no idea where to start. Today we start - I'm not exactly sure where this is headed but I have too many ideas to not at least try it. The plan is to make something with a hearthstone style mana system but also something that differentiates itself from other card games that are already out there

## Step by Step

I'm initially going to write the basic game in ruby and simply play it in the command line, and maybe that's where it ends up permanently - as a command line card game. Ideally though I would like to see it ported to either unity or unreal so I can learn that tech as well, but then I wouldn't be able to write it in ruby T_T

## How to contribute

Literally anything helps here - if you want to contribute card ideas, game design ideas, art, music, or anything in between just email vrodom1@lsu.edu or comment anywhere on the github

## Dependencies (sort of)

You'll need ruby installed and preferably a good command line (ie: not Windows). Running the game is as simple as:

`ruby game.rb`

If you want to update the documentation you'll also need the `rdoc` gem which can be installed with a simple

`gem install rdoc`

Once you have it, using it is as simple as `rdoc game.rb` and bam! You got documentation ripped straight from the comments
